## XonStat Badges

This is badges, the badge-generation code for the free and
open source shooter Xonotic. What's a badge, you say? One of these:

![Antibody's Badge][antibody badge]
![Antibody's Badge][antibody badge 2]

It's an image that shows your summary stats in the game in a nice and tidy way. It's most often used in forum signatures. 

## How Do I Get One?

Find your player page on [XonStat][xonstat]. This is easiest to do after you've played a tracked game. Find the game in the "recent games" table at the bottom of the leaderboard page, then click on your nickname to reach your player info page. Right below your nickname at the top of the page is some text containing your player number. It's also in the URL at the top of the same page.

Once you have your player ID, plug it into one of the following URLs:

`https://stats.xonotic.org/static/badges/<PLAYER_ID>.jpg`

`https://stats.xonotic.org/static/badges/archer/<PLAYER_ID>.jpg`

`https://stats.xonotic.org/static/badges/minimal/<PLAYER_ID>.jpg`

Each of the URLs displays the same basic information, but with different styling. Choose whichever one you like the best!
